# rock-paper-scissors

Fun litle rock, paper, scissors demo where the plays against the computer by typing in their choice of RPC. The project will give me good practice using loops, conditional statements, and functions. 

After the initial game has been built and can be played in the console, I will go back in and add a UI using DOM manipulation and CSS. The end goal is to have a webpage where the user can play against the computer using bottons on a clean, functional interface w/ out having to type in their input.
