# rock-paper-scissors

## Description:

This is a fun litle rock, paper, scissors demo where the user plays against the computer by inputting their choice of RPC. The interface will keep a running score total and notify the user what the computer picks (rock, paper, or scissors) as well as the winner of each round. The goal of this project is to practice developing a project from scratch. 

## Approach: 

The first implementation of the game will be played in the console. Inputs will be prompted from the user and letting them type in their choice of rock, paper, or scissors. The primary goal here is to make sure that the game logic funcitons properly and the score counters accurately reflect the scores. 

After the initial game has been built and can be played in the console, I will go back in and add a UI using JS, DOM manipulation and CSS. The end goal is to have a webpage that allows the user to play against the computer using buttons on a clean, functional interface w/ out having to type in their input. 

## Skills/Methods Used:

* DOM manipulation for button functionality and live scoreboard
* Basic use of JavaScript functions, conditional statements, and loops as well as other JS fundamentals for game logic
* CSS styling for basic user interfaces
* Git & GitHub for version control 

## Technologies Used:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Git & GitHub
* Chrome dev. tools
* MacOS Terminal
* VS Code
